# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from earlier phases of development.

## Archived Files

### DEMO.md
Phase 1 demo walkthrough. Superseded by comprehensive README.md Quick Start section.

### DEMO_PHASE2.md
Phase 2 (AI Processing) demo guide. Features now integrated into main README.md.

### QUICKSTART.md
Quick reference for early development. Now replaced by:
- README.md Quick Start section
- STATUS.md for current state
- STRUCTURE.md for architecture

### DOCS_INDEX.md
Navigation guide for multiple documentation files. Simplified structure no longer needs this level of indexing.

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see the project root:

- **README.md** - User guide, installation, all commands, Quick Start
- **STATUS.md** - Current phase status, complete command reference, schema
- **STRUCTURE.md** - Architecture details, project structure, development guide
- **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Full roadmap and phase specifications

## Why Archived?

These files were useful during early development but became redundant as the project matured. The information has been consolidated into:

1. **README.md** - All user-facing features and commands
2. **STATUS.md** - Current state and capabilities
3. **STRUCTURE.md** - Technical architecture

This simplification makes it easier for new users and contributors to find information without navigating multiple overlapping documents.
