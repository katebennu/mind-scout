### Optional: AI Features Setup

To use AI-powered features (summarization, topic extraction), you need an Anthropic API key:

1. Get a key from https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Set environment variable:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Profile

Tell Mind Scout what you're interested in:

```bash
# Set your research interests
mindscout profile set-interests "transformers, reinforcement learning, computer vision"

# Set your skill level
mindscout profile set-skill advanced

# View your profile
mindscout profile show
```

### 2. Discover Papers

Fetch papers from multiple sources:

```bash
# Quick fetch from arXiv (latest papers)
mindscout fetch -c cs.AI -c cs.LG

# Advanced search: Papers from last 30 days
mindscout search -k "large language models" --last-days 30

# Find high-impact papers (Semantic Scholar)
mindscout search --source semanticscholar -q "diffusion models" --min-citations 100 -n 20

# Filter by year and citations
mindscout search --source semanticscholar -q "GPT" --year 2024
```

### 3. Get Personalized Recommendations

Let Mind Scout suggest papers based on your interests:

```bash
# Get top 10 recommendations
mindscout recommend

# Get recommendations with detailed explanations
mindscout recommend --explain

# Include papers from last 60 days
mindscout recommend -d 60 -n 15
```

### 4. Read and Rate Papers

Track what you've read and rate papers:

```bash
# List unread articles
mindscout list --unread -n 20

# View article details (with citations if available)
mindscout show 5

# Mark as read
mindscout read 5

# Rate the paper (1-5 stars)
mindscout rate 5 4
```

### 5. Process with AI (Optional)

Use Claude to extract insights:

```bash
# Process articles for topic extraction
mindscout process --limit 10

# View discovered topics
mindscout topics

# Find articles by topic
mindscout find-by-topic "attention mechanism"
```

### 6. Use Semantic Search

Find papers using natural language and similarity:

```bash
# Index articles for semantic search (run once, or after fetching new papers)
mindscout index

# Search using natural language
mindscout semantic-search "attention mechanisms in transformers" -n 10

# Find papers similar to one you liked
mindscout similar 42 -n 5
```

### 7. Track Your Progress

View your reading analytics:

```bash
# See your reading insights
mindscout insights

# View collection statistics
mindscout stats
```

## Commands

### `mindscout fetch`
Fetch latest articles from arXiv RSS feeds (simple, fast).

Options:
- `-c, --categories`: Specify categories to fetch (can be used multiple times)

Example:
```bash
mindscout fetch -c cs.AI -c cs.CV
```

### `mindscout search`
Universal search command supporting multiple sources (arXiv and Semantic Scholar).

Common Options:
- `--source`: Choose source - `arxiv` (default) or `semanticscholar`
- `-n, --max-results`: Maximum results (default: 100)
- `-q, --query`: Search query (required for Semantic Scholar)

**arXiv Options:**
- `-k, --keywords`: Keywords to search for
- `-c, --categories`: Filter by categories
- `-a, --author`: Search by author name
- `-t, --title`: Search in titles
- `--last-days N`: Fetch papers from last N days
- `--from-date YYYY-MM-DD`: Start date
- `--to-date YYYY-MM-DD`: End date
- `--sort-by`: Sort by `submittedDate`, `lastUpdatedDate`, or `relevance`
- `--sort-order`: `ascending` or `descending`

**Semantic Scholar Options:**
- `-q, --query`: Search query (required)
- `--ss-sort`: Sort order - `citationCount:desc` (default), `citationCount:asc`, `publicationDate:desc`, `publicationDate:asc`
- `--year YEAR`: Filter by year (e.g., "2024" or "2020-2024")
- `--min-citations N`: Minimum citation count

Examples:
```bash
# arXiv: Papers from last month about transformers
mindscout search -k "transformer" --last-days 30

# arXiv: Papers by specific author
mindscout search -a "Hinton" --last-days 365 -n 20

# Semantic Scholar: Most cited papers
mindscout search --source semanticscholar -q "large language models" -n 20

# Semantic Scholar: Filter by year and citations
mindscout search --source semanticscholar -q "transformers" --year 2024 --min-citations 100

# Semantic Scholar: Sort by recent papers
mindscout search --source semanticscholar -q "diffusion models" --ss-sort publicationDate:desc
```

**Note:** This unified command replaces the old `fetch-semantic-scholar` command. arXiv doesn't support citation-based sorting, but Semantic Scholar does!

mindscout recommend --explain
```

### `mindscout rate <article_id> <rating>`

Example:
```bash
# Rate article 42 as 5 stars
mindscout rate 42 5
```

### `mindscout insights`
Show reading insights and analytics including:
- Total articles, read count, and read percentage
- Articles rated and rating distribution
- Source breakdown for read articles
- Daily reading goal progress

Example:
```bash
mindscout insights
```

### `mindscout index`
Index articles in the vector database for semantic search.

Options:
- `-n, --limit`: Index only N articles (useful for testing)
- `-f, --force`: Re-index articles that are already indexed

Examples:
```bash
# Index all articles
mindscout index

# Index only 50 articles (for testing)
mindscout index -n 50

# Re-index all articles
mindscout index --force
```

**Note:** Run this after fetching new articles to enable semantic search on them. Initial indexing may take a few minutes depending on the number of articles.

### `mindscout similar <article_id>`
Find articles semantically similar to a given article.

Options:
- `-n, --limit`: Number of similar articles to show (default: 10)
- `--min-similarity`: Minimum similarity score 0-1 (default: 0.3)

Examples:

# Find similar articles with at least 50% similarity
mindscout similar 42 --min-similarity 0.5
```

### `mindscout semantic-search <query>`
Search for articles using natural language queries. Uses semantic similarity to find relevant papers even if they don't contain exact keywords.

Options:
- `-n, --limit`: Number of results to show (default: 10)

Examples:
```bash
# Search for papers about attention mechanisms
mindscout semantic-search "attention mechanisms in transformers"

# Find papers about a specific topic
mindscout semantic-search "diffusion models for image generation" -n 20

# Use natural language descriptions
mindscout semantic-search "how to train large language models efficiently"
```

**Note:** Semantic search finds papers based on meaning, not just keywords. This is more powerful than traditional keyword search.

### `mindscout clear`
Clear all articles from the database.

Options:
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompt

Example:
```bash
# With confirmation
mindscout clear

# Skip confirmation
mindscout clear --force
```

**Warning:** This permanently deletes all articles. Use with caution!

## Configuration

Mind Scout stores data in `~/.mindscout/` by default. You can change this by setting the `MINDSCOUT_DATA_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export MINDSCOUT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/data
```

### arXiv Categories
